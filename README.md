# ForintFlipper

A very simple and minimalistic coin flipper app written in Flutter. It differs from the other coin flipper apps out there in two ways:
- The code is way less elegant and optimized
- It uses Hungarian Forints (which you should definitely invest in <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1110638202659811440.webp?size=16&quality=lossless">)

## Setup

Run `git clone https://github.com/bzbrn/ForintFlipper.git`  
Navigate into the folder: `cd ForintFlipper`  
Run the app using `flutter run`
